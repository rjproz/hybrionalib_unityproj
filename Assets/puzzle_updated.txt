Challenge: Find the Name of the Book



-------------------------

Checkpoint 1

Hello, I am a time traveler. Currently, I am in the year 2009. I want to sing, but my voice sounds like a crow—lol. I just bought an iPhone, and someone told me that an iOS app can help me with auto-tune. Which is the best app for it? I need an app that I could have downloaded in 2009.

-------------------------


Checkpoint 2


The Zeeman effect refers to the splitting of a spectral line into multiple components when exposed to a static magnetic field. This occurs due to the interaction between the magnetic field and the magnetic moment of an atomic electron, which is influenced by both its orbital motion and spin. As a result, certain orbital energies shift more than others, leading to the spectral line splitting.

Who discovered it?

-------------------------

Checkpoint 3


Now you know his name! He even received a Nobel Prize for his discovery. But he wasn’t the only one—he shared the prize with someone else. Who was it?

-------------------------

Checkpoint 4

Now, take that person’s birth date, but replace the year with 2003. Several movies were released on that day.

Your task? Find the movie with the highest budget among them.

-------------------------

Checkpoint 5

I hope you found the movie name. If so, you should have its details.

The lead actor of that movie has also starred in a great science fiction film. That sci-fi film has multiple sequels, but I won’t reveal how many.

In one of the sequels, the lead actor loses his memory. In that film, a certain person made a cameo appearance.

Who is that person?

-------------------------

Checkpoint 6

Now that you know this person, find out where they were born—it could be a country, state, or city.

Remove the last two letters from that place’s name, and you’ll get the name of a country.

At some point between 1700 AD and 1800 AD, a ruler invaded this country and attacked its capital city. This ruler is known by multiple names, including one like "Sword of ??"—a title that contains a word also found in the name of a popular video game.

This game has multiple versions and sequels, and in one of them, the player travels to the past to change their fate.

Among all the enemies in the game, one stands out as the most powerful. Identify that enemy.


-------------------------

Checkpoint 7

So you have the most powerful enemy. The character's voice is iconic, thanks to the talented voice actor behind it.

That voice actor also played the main character in a famous TV series.

In that series, another actor played a role as “Tucker.”

This actor also appeared in a film released in 2009. Find details about that film.

-------------------------

Checkpoint 8

Now that you have the film (you should, otherwise you can’t solve this!), focus on its soundtrack.

There is a specific song/soundtrack in that film that lasts for 57 seconds. Its title is also the name of a software program.

Find the name of the version of that software released in 2015. That name is also associated with a massive object.



-------------------------

Checkpoint 9

Solve this, and you’ll uncover the final clue about the book’s name.

In 2015, a groundbreaking discovery was made related to this object. Which organization, company, or scientist was responsible for this discovery?


-------------------------


Checkpoint 10

Now, your task is to find a 12-digit number:

    The first four digits represent the year a ship sank in Norway—this ship was used for transporting slaves.
    The next four digits correspond to the Gene ID (NCBI) related to IFI27.
    The last four digits are the birth year of the person or organization from Checkpoint 9.

Now that you have the 12-digit number:
    Multiply the result by 55.
    Add 54667051240.

The final number is the code needed to find the name of the book.

The answer must be exact—without decimals or exponents. You may need to use a big calculator, possibly online!
